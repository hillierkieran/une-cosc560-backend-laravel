# Report

### My Approach

The bulk of the assignment was achieved by following along from the lecture videos. From that point, I used a combination of exploring the code, reading documentation and searching online to achieve the functionality required by the assignment.

### Challenges Faced

I have faced a few challenges during this project so far. I'm not sure what initially triggered it, but Laragon started showing errors about the `php_curl.dll` file which I fixed by updating Apache. My other hurdles related to figuring out how to add the edit and delete functionality to the posts. This was mostly a matter of becoming familiar with how the code worked, reading documentation and searching online for solutions.

### Extra Features

I don't think I have added any additional features of note.
